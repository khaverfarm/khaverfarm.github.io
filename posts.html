ברוכים הבאים!
Welcome to our farm and first post!

For those who haven't been in the know it's probably worth mentioning that Jess and I live in a tent. It's not what you think (probably?) It's a yurt, a Mongolian inspired, New Hampshire built, poorly insulated 3-ish season structure that we put up with the help of friends and family in 2022. We live on an undeveloped  stream laden plot in the woods of Cummington, recently purchased by our long time friend. Yes, we poop in an outhouse, yes it gets cold in the winter but we have a wood stove, no we don’t have running water we lug it in by the 5 gallon bottle full, yes we have electricity from solar, and no we don’t really have internet. Lots of these facts were mostly perks when we decided to buy this bundle of vinyl and saplings in the fall of 2021. We’re not Luddites in the misconceived way, we like our technology but mostly we like the communities we’ve been fortunate to be a part of through it. Like many, the pandemic, the economy and climate change enticed us to grow a garden and evidently that was not enough. So here we are, quite a few ‘career’ changes later, we’re starting a farm on land we just purchased in the charming hilltowns of Western Massachusetts on unceded Mohican land in a town known as Plainfield. The following is our year in retrospect. 

With love and in solidarity,
Yonatan and Jess

January

January ended up being a month of reflection. As people who have two settings (on and off) that month had us feeling idle, not knowing yet that the rest we were being afforded was so necessary to the life of seasons we were seeking. We spent most of it reading, and kvetching, but mostly reading - about the things we didn’t know yet like what it takes to buy land, build a house and raise poultry for money. Fortunately we had plenty of time, free from the labor intensive off-grid lifestyle we had been living, for we had scored a cushy house sitting job in exotic Buffalo New York. 

February 

With fire under our bums and naive confidence only youth can buy, we endeavored to find a silver bullet to our house building challenge. We decided we’d pursue the pre-fab and kit build approach. After not much research we found that while the prefab options were enticing in their low effort solutions, they ended up costing close to and often more than a larger sized existing structure. So we decided the kit-build made the most sense, why not take the money that you’d pay someone else (a professional who knows what they’re doing) and do it ourselves (overzealous amateurs) with a kit designed by a ‘professional’ who just wants the youths to afford housing! Sounds too good to be true right? Welp, to put it shortly, the day we ended up visiting our first kit builder was also the day we ended up visiting the ER for the first time in our area. Needless to say, it didn’t go well. 

A second (more like 4th) attempt in the kit building search actually proved fruitful with a visit to Shelter Kit. With a fresh baked Babka and a binder full of questions we met the founder in his own shelter kit home to talk shop. We left impressed and relieved, confident that this would be a viable, albeit labor intensive journey. What was one more challenge to our increasing list of young adulthood antics? 


March

We took our new home base in Lexington Massachusetts as an opportunity to scout the snow covered parcels on Zillow - prime for the bidding. Little did we know of course that no one was bidding on those plots, not in that season, or ever more for reasons that would soon become evident. Namely, wetlands and flood zones. If it’s too good to be true it’s probably a FEMA flood plain or a state jurisdiction buffer zone. So we added those red flags to our land purchasing parameters and narrowed in on a 3 acre plot in Cummington and on March 3rd we placed an offer contingent on a lovely list of things we googled and had our lovely lawyer and agent put together, thank goodness for them!
