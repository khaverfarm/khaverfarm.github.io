It's not what you think (probably?) It's a yurt, a Mongolian inspired, New Hampshire built, poorly insulated 3-ish season structure that we put up with the help of friends and family in 2022. We live on an undeveloped, stream laden, plot in the woods of Cummington recently purchased by our long time friend. Yes, we poop in an outhouse, yes it gets cold in the winter but we have a wood stove, no we don't have running water we lug it in by the 5 gallon jug full, yes we have electricity from solar, and no we don't really have internet. Lots of these facts were mostly perks when we decided to buy this bundle of vinyl and saplings in the fall of 2021. We're not Luddites in the misconceived way, we like our technology but mostly we like the communities we've been fortunate to be a part of through it. Like many, the pandemic, the economy and climate change enticed us to grow a garden and evidently that was not enough. So here we are, quite a few 'career' changes later, starting a farm on land we just purchased in the charming hilltowns of Western Massachusetts on unceded Mohican land in a town known as Plainfield. The following post is our year in retrospect. \n\nWith love and in solidarity,\nYonatan and Jess\n\nJanuary\n\nJanuary ended up being a month of reflection. As people who have two settings (on and off) that month had us feeling idle, not knowing yet that the rest we were being afforded was so necessary to the life of seasons we were seeking. We spent most of it reading, and kvetching, but mostly reading - about the things we didn't know yet like what it takes to buy land, build a house and raise poultry for money. Fortunately we had plenty of time, free from the labor intensive off-grid lifestyle we had been living, for we had scored a cushy house sitting job in exotic Buffalo New York. \n\nFebruary - March\n\nWith fire under our bums and naive confidence only youth and cabin fever can buy, we endeavored to find a silver bullet to our house building challenge. We decided we'd pursue the pre-fab and kit build approach. After not much research we found that while the prefab options were enticing in their low effort solutions, they ended up costing close to and often more than a larger sized existing structure. So we decided the kit-build made the most sense, why not take the money that you'd pay someone else (a professional who knows what they're doing) and do it ourselves (overzealous amateurs) with a kit designed by a ‚Äòprofessional' who just wants the youths to afford housing! Sounds too good to be true right? Welp, to put it shortly, the day we ended up visiting our first kit builder was also the day we ended up visiting the ER for the first time in our area. Needless to say, it didn't go well. \n\nA second (more like 4th) attempt in the kit building search actually proved fruitful with a visit to Shelter Kit. With a fresh baked Babka and a binder full of questions we met the founder in his own shelter kit home to talk shop. We left impressed and relieved, confident that this would be a viable, albeit labor intensive journey. What was one more challenge to our increasing list of young adulthood antics? \n\nWe took our new home base in Lexington Massachusetts as an opportunity to scout the snow covered parcels on Zillow - prime for the bidding. Little did we know of course that no one was bidding on those plots, not in that season, or ever more for reasons that would soon become evident. Namely, wetlands and flood zones. If it's too good to be true it's probably a FEMA flood plain or a state jurisdiction buffer zone. So we added those red flags to our land purchasing parameters and narrowed in on a 3 acre plot in Cummington and on March 3rd we placed an offer contingent on a list of things we googled and had our lovely lawyer and agent put together, thank goodness for them! \n\nApril - May\n \nAt this point we were itching to leave the house. As much as living with one's parents has its perks, without full time jobs or meaningful labor one can be driven a little mad from the monotony of the suburbs. We were given the opportunity to scrap a cape house for its parts destined for demolition. We scored eight windows and a gleaming sense of pride that we could chip away at our future building expenses without our corporate jobs. Inspired, and a little aimless, we decided to start businesses! Who knew we'd finally become the startup CEOs we were groomed to be? We put up posters and social media posts and within a week we had more work than we had time. It was during one of Jess' pet sitting gigs that we were visioning our year ahead and decided that what we needed more than anything was experience and proof we could be loaned money for that future house. A w2 paying farm job it was, and by early May we had our trial days at a poultry farm and processing facility.  \n\n\n\nJune - July\n\nWith a new chicken job, construction business and animal care service we were doing all the things we could manage to get us to our farming dream. We were working 6 days a week and managing to observe shabbat in increasingly meaningful ways. On June 1st at 8am we had our perktest scheduled and before 830 it was over. Turns out that the plot had never been purchased because of shallow the soil was. \n\noand harvest, gobi birthday week grateful dead concert, our offer was accepted at cambpell, HHF bryna gutters and capacitors, klez cummington, the FLOODS, alder and Ray, flat tire #1, garlic harvest, vegan pizza land w/Curl, first Ren and Steve job taking out insulation, \n\n\nAugust - September \n\nPhilly!
